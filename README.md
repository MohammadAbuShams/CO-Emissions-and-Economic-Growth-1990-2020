## 📘 Project Overview
This Tableau project explores how **CO₂ emissions** and **economic growth (GDP per capita)** have evolved across countries and regions between **1990 and 2020**.  
The data story visualizes the link between environmental impact and development levels, showing how industrial growth, population expansion, and renewable energy transitions have shaped emissions patterns worldwide.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between **economic growth** and **CO₂ emissions** over time.  
- Identify key regions and countries that show distinct trends.  
- Highlight periods of sharp increase or decline in emissions with annotations.  
- Create a **data-driven story** using Tableau’s interactive dashboards and animation features.

---

## 🗺️ Story Structure
The Tableau Story includes **five main tabs**:
1. **Introduction –** Overview of global emissions and project goals.  
2. **Global View –** A worldwide map showing emissions distribution.  
3. **Regional Focus (MENA) –** Focused view on the Middle East & North Africa region.  
4. **Country Focus (Jordan & Egypt) –** Country-level emission trends over time.  
5. **Conclusions –** Key takeaways and insights from the data.

## 🧩 Visual Components
### 1. **Animated Global Map**
- Displays countries by **average CO₂ emissions per capita**.
- **Color gradient:** Blue (low) → Red (high).
- **Size of circles:** Represents **GDP per capita (PPP)**.
- **Animation:** Plays through years (1990–2020) to show trends over time.

### 2. **Line Chart: Emission Trends Over Time**
- Compares **GDP per capita** and **CO₂ emissions** for selected countries.
- Includes **annotations** to highlight significant events such as:
  - Rapid industrial growth after 2004.  
  - Decline after 2011 due to renewable energy shifts.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Economic growth** is often accompanied by **increased CO₂ emissions**, especially in developing regions.
- **Middle East & North Africa** shows steady growth but with rising environmental impact.
- **Egypt** experienced industrial-driven increases post-2004, followed by a decline after 2011 due to energy reforms.
- **Policy shifts and renewable energy adoption** play a major role in stabilizing emissions.
